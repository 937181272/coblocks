A suite of Gutenberg blocks for writers, publishers and content marketers.

== Description ==

[CoBlocks](https://coblocks.com?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=coblocks) is a collection of Gutenberg blocks built by the folks at [ThemeBeans](https://themebeans.com?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=coblocks).

Our vision has always been to create WordPress products that are entirely user-first. That deliver a first-rate experience, second to none.

**CoBlocks delivers on all fronts.**

= A new way to WordPress =

We built [CoBlocks](https://coblocks.com?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=coblocks) for the next-generation block editor, codenamed Gutenberg. This new block editor absolutely empowers people to create rich content in such an intuitive fashion.

Building on top of this new foundational change in content creation, CoBlocks leverages Gutenberg to add even more functionality to the block editor. Space out content, drop in social icons, add gifs â€” all of these, and more, are new blocks powered by CoBlocks.

This plugin is created and maintained by [Rich Tabor](https://richtabor.com?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=coblocks).
